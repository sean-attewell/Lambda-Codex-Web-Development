// Stateful logic is logic that is built into a component. 
// It can be a function that handles a click event or maybe a function that sets toggle state, or even a function that formats data before it gets displayed.
// Usually, this kind of logic deals with state in the component. Thus the moniker "stateful logic."

import React, { useState } from "react";

const DynamicTitle = () => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState("Hooks are so fun!");
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState("");

  const handleChanges = e => {
    setInputText(e.target.value);
  };

  const changeTitle = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setTitle(inputText);
    setInputText("");
  };

  return (
    <div className="Wrapper">
      <h1 className="Title">{title}</h1>
      <form onSubmit={changeTitle}>
        <div className="Input">
          <input
            className="Input-text"
            id="input"
            name="inputText"
            onChange={handleChanges}
            placeholder="Create new title"
            type="text"
            value={inputText}
          />
          <label htmlFor="input" className="Input-label">
            New title

export default DynamicTitle;


// handleChanges and changeTitle are the stateful logic.
// And we can probably also count the title and inputText state in there as well. 
// Those are all great examples of stateful logic. 
// And really, the sky's the limit on what could be considered stateful logic in a React component.


// Custom Hooks, are so-called because you are building the hook yourself (customizing it), 
// to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout your components. 
// This way, you can reuse the same hook over and over again. 
// Custom hooks follow the same patterns of naming that you've already learned (i.e. prefacing the function name with use, as in useState). 
// You can build a reusable custom hook for anything from handling controlled inputs, to managing event listeners, or watching for key presses.


// Now, what happens if we need to issue state for multiple input tags? 
// If we were to follow the lead of the patterns shown above, we would end up having to rewrite large amounts of our code 
// for each useState call that we've invoked in order to create state for our second, third, and fourth inputs.

// Instead, let's build out our **custom hook** that to reuse stateful logic. In this way, we avoid repeating code unnecessarily

export const useInput = initialValue => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
  const handleChanges = updatedValue => { 
    setValue(updatedValue);
  };
  return [value, setValue, handleChanges];
};

// In this useInput custom hook function, we're taking in an initialValue and returning three new values. 
// We pass initialValue as a parameter on the function. 
// initialValue is then passed into the useState hook, which returns an array with our value variable and setValue function 
// Next, we have a handleChanges function that uses the setValue function to update state to a new value. 
// Finally, we return an array from our useInput custom hook containing the value variable, the setValue function, and the handleChanges function.

// why does handleChanges exist when we already have setValue? 
// Handle is used in JSX, setValue is used to directly edit state (e.g. when resetting it )

// Let's take a look at this custom hook when it's imported and used in a component.

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useInput } from "./useInput.js"; // Our custom hook

const CustomForm = () => {

  const [username, setUsername, handleUsername] = useInput("");
  const [password, setPassword, handlePassword] = useInput("");
  const [email, setEmail, handleEmail] = useInput("");

  const resetValues = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setUsername("");
    setPassword("");
    setEmail("");
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={resetValues}>
      <input
        className="username-text"
        id="username"
        name="username"
        onChange={e => handleUsername(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Username"
        type="text"
        value={username}
      />
      <input
        className="password-test"
        id="password"
        name="password"
        onChange={e => handlePassword(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Password"
        type="password"
        value={password}
      />
      <input
        className="email-text"
        id="email"
        name="email"
        onChange={e => handleEmail(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Email"
        type="text"
        value={email}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default CustomForm;


// First off, notice that we're invoking the useInput custom hook three times at the top of the component 
// and passing in an empty string as each one's initial value:

const [username, setUsername, handleUsername] = useInput("");
const [password, setPassword, handlePassword] = useInput("");
const [email, setEmail, handleEmail] = useInput("");

// Our useInput hook returns a new copy of our custom hook and state each time. 
// Also, because array destructuring is based on positioning and not the name, 
// we are allowed by JavaScript to name each of the three items returned from useInput in different ways. 
// This is why we can set the first item to username, the second to setUsername, and the third to handleUsername 
// while the next two useInput calls return differently-named variables and functions.

// From these invocations, it now becomes easy to rig up each of our input tags in our JSX just the same as we did before. 

// Notice how we are setting our handleUsername, handlePassword, and handleEmail functions to process changes to the input. 
// Remember how we returned a handleChanges function from our custom hook? 
// Well, we've renamed them here (again, thanks to array destructuring) and are using them just the same as before. 
// However, now, we have less code for them in our component.

// The final thing you should notice is the resetValue function. 
// When we invoke it, we use the setValues returned from each useInput (again, each one is named differently) 
// and pass it in our reset value (in this case, an empty string). 

// ** Basically the main change from the first example is no longer needing a custom change handler function for each input **
// ** Instead it just gets returned from our useInput custom hook we made ***

// By building out a custom hook, we can skip writing out all of the stateful logic for our non-visual behavior. 
// Custom hooks produce beautiful, DRY code that is easy to read and use. 
// You have built a reusable piece of code that makes it easy for you to import anywhere 
// in your application and build out stateful logic in any of your components.



// we can extend our stateful logic by combining several hooks in a powerful, single custom hook. 
// This compositional ability allows us to build out interesting abilities by combining various hooks in our application.

// We can develop this complexity using multiple hooks inside a single custom hook. 
// We've done this already when we called useState inside useInput. Pretty cool! 
// Now imagine writing several custom hooks and combining all of that logic into a single custom hook to use in your components. 
// The possibilities are dizzying! And amazing! 
// Let's try it out by expanding the useInput custom hook we've already built.

// We need to start by building out a second custom hook. 
// Later on, we'll combine it with the useInput custom hook from the previous objective to achieve a more compelling hook with multiple pieces of stateful logic.
// First, we'll implement the new hook that we will call useLocalStorage:

import { useState } from "react";

const useLocalStorage = (key, initialValue) => {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
    return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
  });
  const setValue = value => {
    setStoredValue(value);
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  };
  return [storedValue, setValue];
};

// First, we pass in a key-value (like: "input1," "input2" ) and an initialValue. 
// These two parameters (key and value) are used in the useState hook call and used immediately inside our custom hooks. 
// Instead of just passing in an initial value to this useState hook, we are using an anonymous arrow function as a callback to do two things:
// Check if the window.localStorage has a specific item (retrieved by key) in it
// Return that item from local storage if it exists or the initialValue otherwise
// Because of this, our hook can now successfully check to see if a specific state item exists in localStorage, 
// and it can use that item if it exists instead of the provided initialValue. 

// Then, we also have a setValue function that takes a value as a parameter, 
// sets it to the current storedValue by using the setStoredValue provided by useState, 
// and sets it localStorage. 
// As our state is now stored, our custom hook will check here on refresh to see if the state exists.


// Now that we have a custom hook for controlling value placement (and updates) in localStorage, we can combine it with useInput to create powerful logic:

import { useState } from "react";

export const useInput = (key, initialValue) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useLocalStorage(key, initialValue);
  const handleChanges = updatedValue => {
    setValue(updatedValue);
  };
  return [value, setValue, handleChanges];
};

const useLocalStorage = (key, initialValue) => {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
    return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
  });
  const setValue = value => {
    setStoredValue(value);
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  };
  return [storedValue, setValue];
};


// While our useLocalStorage hook has stayed the same, our useInput custom hook has some nice upgrades going on. 
// Instead of implementing useState from React as before, we're now using useLocalStorage (which itself uses useState).
// Furthermore, we're also taking in two parameters instead of one - key and initialValue. 
// These are then passed directly into the useLocalStorage hook. 
// Immediately, the hook sets about implementing special logic with the variables as described above. 
// This returns to our useInput custom hook with either a value from localStorage or our initialValue, 
// and our useInput custom hook then returns a value, setValue function, and a handleChanges function in an array just the same as it did before.

// Now when we call the useInput hook in a component to control inputs dynamically, 
// we just need to pass in a unique key for each input to keep track of it in localStorage. Something like this:

const [username, setUsername, handleUsername] = useInput("userName", "");
const [password, setPassword, handlePassword] = useInput("password", "");
const [email, setEmail, handleEmail] = useInput("email", "");

// Although this isn't something you will often do (storing input values in localStorage), this setup is quite powerful, 
// and it effectively demonstrates how composable hooks can be; 
// by combining the stateful logic of multiple custom hooks, you can compose a really nice custom hook with advanced stateful logic.

// One final thing to note is that we can employ the useLocalStorage custom hook in other places now as well. 
// So, not only do we have an extra-powerful useInput created by composing multiple hooks together, 
// we also have another custom hook available to us anytime we want to persist data in localStorage.
