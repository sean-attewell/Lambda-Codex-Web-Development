// Reactstrap, the de-facto Bootstrap Styling library for React Components.

// What's great about this library is that you have some pre-built components that are already styled out for you using the Bootstrap styling library. 
// So not only do you get a chance to use the Bootstrap styling library, 
// but you also get interactive styled components that you can use for interactivity throughout your react application.

// If you head over to the documentation, you'll find that the installation process is pretty darn easy.

// npm install reactstrap bootstrap

// Notice that we're installing BOTH Reactstrap and Bootstrap here. Reactstrap is the component library that uses Bootstrap under the hood. So you'll need both. 
// To get the stylesheet included to your React Application, you can either use the script tag option or, my preferred choice, 
// import the bootstrap library into your index.js file.

// import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

// Adding that line to your index.js file will make the bootstrap style sheet available. Now how do we use the React Strap component library?
// Well, it's as simple as any other node package we're using. 
// Wherever you want to include any of your Reactstrap components, you'll have to explicitly import them into any component that you'd like to use them in.

// import React from 'react';
// import { Alert } from 'reactstrap';
// That Alert component is now available for use like any other component that you've worked with/built on your own. And we'll use it as such.

{/* <Alert color="primary">
  This is a primary alert â€” check it out!
</Alert> */}

// This example comes straight from the docs, and of course, there is a bit more to it than that. So we'll dive into an example and have you all follow along with me right now.
